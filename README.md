A simple incremental backup system

This is work in progress. This is an attempt to write a simple,
incremental backup system.

The core functionality will be done by a shell script. I will write a GTK
interface around it to configure it and run manual backups if the user wants
to.

This work is inspired by 
[this old article](http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/)
